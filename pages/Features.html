            <h4>The Green City</h4>

                Nairobi, popularly known as “Green City in the Sun” has an amazing culture, which is unparalleled in any other city. The city is known for its sheer natural beauty that will take your breath away.	Nairobi is a lively city, full of culture, historically rich,
                home to beautiful national parks and wildlife. </p>
                <br></br>
               <p>The name “Nairobi” comes from the Maasai phrase 'Enkare Nyrobi', which translates to “cool water”. The area Nairobi currently occupies was essentially uninhabited swamp until a supply depot of the Uganda Railway was built by the British in 1899 linking Mombasa to Uganda.   </p>
               <br></br>
               <p> Nairobi is a somewhat disorderly city and is a hectic mix of old, new, rich and poor. It can be overwhelming to visit for some, however some thrive in this environemnt of chashes with Masai on mopeds and shantis next to sky skrapers. You must be wary wandering around though, as it has unfortunately become a bit of a hot spot for thievery.</p>
               <br></br>
               <p> Kenya's capital Nairobi is a bustling and at times chaotic city, with a very wealthy upper class and an exceptionally poor lower class. Masai warriors in full regalia speak on mobile phones and ride motor bikes, while tourists haggle with street sellers for African curios by vast tower blocks or shanty towns. This is certainly a fascinating city, but it has earned the unfortunate nickname Nai'robbery and you do need to keep your wits about you when exploring here! Visitors either love Nairobi or hate it. </p>
               <br></br>
               <p>There is plenty to see and do in Nairobi to keep visitors occupied while passing through. The David Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage and the giraffes of Giraffe Manor are perennial favourites, and tours of Kibera (Africa's largest slum) offer a stark
                insight into the reality of life for 250,000 of Nairobi's poorest citizens. The city also offers the best shopping in East Africa.</p>
